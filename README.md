# Examples

## Intro:

This repository contains examples of some web devel features such as
- Alternating a float
- A button that changes its text when the cursor hovers over it, ...

I write the examples as I progress in my Web devel learning thus
they show differnt levels of expertise.

Some examples have explanations that can be read in the browser, 
For others, you have to look at the html and sass files.
