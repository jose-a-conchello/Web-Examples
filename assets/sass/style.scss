/* 
  Where to place:
    typography: 
      Before variables:
        Allows defining variables that use the fonts in
        typography. However, it prevents the use of variables in
        the typography partial. Using variables is necessary when,
        for example, different classes and/or elements use equal
        properties such as font-size, font-weight, ...
      After variables: 
        Allows using variables in the typography partial. However,
        it prevents the use of variables for the fonts in the
        typography partial.
      Within variables: 
        Ruins the separation of partials by function.
     
      Other approach:
        Keep the typography variables within the typography
        partial.
        Use the variables partial for variables that are general
        in the sense that they are used for more than one purpose.
